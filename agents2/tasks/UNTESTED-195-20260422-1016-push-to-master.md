# Push to Master

## GitHub Issues
- **Issue:** https://github.com/satisfecho/pos/issues/195
- **195**

## Problem / goal
Promote tested work from **`development`** to **`master`** so production (e.g. **amvara9**) can run current code. After deploy, confirm the **GitHub Actions** deployment workflow completed successfully (per issue text).

Follow repo branching rules: routine promotion timing vs urgent production fixes — see **`.cursor/rules/git-development-branch-workflow.mdc`**.

## High-level instructions for coder
- Confirm **`development`** is synced with **`origin/development`** and reflects the intended release scope (no accidental WIP).
- Merge **`development` → `master`** only when allowed by team rules (cadence, production-impacting trigger, or explicit urgent/production request on the issue). Align with **`docs/agent-loop.md`**.
- Push **`master`** to **`origin`** when merging for production.
- Deploy to **amvara9** using the documented path (see **`docs/0001-ci-cd-amvara9.md`**, **`scripts/deploy-amvara9.sh`** as referenced in **`README.md`** / **`AGENTS.md`**).
- For “review the success status of the deployment action on GitHub”: open the repo’s **Actions** tab for the relevant workflow run and verify success; capture any failure logs for follow-up without pasting secrets.
- Post a short summary on the issue when promotion/deploy is done (what was merged, whether CI/deploy is green).

## Implementation summary (feature coder)
- **`development`** was synced with **`origin/development`** (already up to date).
- **`master`** was fast-forwarded to **`7a2c2bd`** (same tip as **`development`** after promotion) and pushed to **`origin/master`** (issue explicitly requested production promotion).
- **GitHub Actions — Deploy to amvara9** run **`24773000757`** (triggered by **`master`** push) **failed** at step **Fetch marketing site artifacts**: sync script reported **no `MARKETING_ARTIFACT_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN`** in that job’s environment, could not download marketing bundles, and **`MARKETING_VERIFY_NO_PLACEHOLDERS=1`** failed with placeholder bundles for slugs **antillana**, **dilruba**, **flamanapolitana**, **gustazo**, **hakone**. Server deploy steps did not run.
- **Follow-up (repo settings):** ensure Actions secrets include a PAT with **Actions read** on every repo listed in **`config/marketing-sites.json`** (see error text in workflow logs), then re-run the failed workflow or redeploy.

## Testing instructions

1. **Git:** Confirm **`origin/master`** matches **`origin/development`** at **`7a2c2bd`** (or later if additional commits landed):
   `git fetch origin && git rev-parse origin/master origin/development`
2. **GitHub Actions:** Open **Actions** → **Deploy to amvara9** → run **`24773000757`** (or latest **`master`** deploy). After secrets are fixed, either **Re-run failed jobs** or trigger a new deploy from **`master`** and expect **green** through **Fetch marketing site artifacts**, **Set up SSH**, **Build and restart stack on amvara9**, **Smoke test**.
3. **Optional live check:** After a **green** deploy, verify **`https://satisfecho.de/`** (or documented prod URL) and API health per **`docs/0001-ci-cd-amvara9.md`** / smoke step output.
4. **Manual fallback:** If CI cannot be fixed immediately, an operator may run **`scripts/deploy-amvara9.sh`** from the server checkout per **`README.md`** / **`AGENTS.md`** (still needs marketing bundles resolved for full parity with CI).
