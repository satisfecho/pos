# Push to Master

## GitHub Issues
- **Issue:** https://github.com/satisfecho/pos/issues/195
- **195**

## Problem / goal
Promote tested work from **`development`** to **`master`** so production (e.g. **amvara9**) can run current code. After deploy, confirm the **GitHub Actions** deployment workflow completed successfully (per issue text).

Follow repo branching rules: routine promotion timing vs urgent production fixes — see **`.cursor/rules/git-development-branch-workflow.mdc`**.

## High-level instructions for coder
- Confirm **`development`** is synced with **`origin/development`** and reflects the intended release scope (no accidental WIP).
- Merge **`development` → `master`** only when allowed by team rules (cadence, production-impacting trigger, or explicit urgent/production request on the issue). Align with **`docs/agent-loop.md`**.
- Push **`master`** to **`origin`** when merging for production.
- Deploy to **amvara9** using the documented path (see **`docs/0001-ci-cd-amvara9.md`**, **`scripts/deploy-amvara9.sh`** as referenced in **`README.md`** / **`AGENTS.md`**).
- For “review the success status of the deployment action on GitHub”: open the repo’s **Actions** tab for the relevant workflow run and verify success; capture any failure logs for follow-up without pasting secrets.
- Post a short summary on the issue when promotion/deploy is done (what was merged, whether CI/deploy is green).
