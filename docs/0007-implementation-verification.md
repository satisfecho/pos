## ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Issue 1: Order Status Reset When Adding Items to Ready Order
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**
- **Location**: `back/app/main.py` lines 1956-1962
- **Implementation**: Order status resets from `ready` → `preparing` when new items added
- **Also handles**: `completed` → `pending` reset

### 2. Edge Case 7: Order Modification/Cancellation
**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

#### Implemented Endpoints:
- ✅ `DELETE /menu/{table_token}/order/{order_id}/items/{item_id}` - Remove item (soft delete)

- ✅ `DELETE /menu/{table_token}/order/{order_id}` - Cancel entire order (soft delete)
- ✅ `PUT /orders/{order_id}/items/{item_id}/status` - Update item status (restaurant)

#### Validation:
- ✅ Blocks removal if item is `delivered`
- ✅ Blocks cancellation if any item is `delivered`
- ✅ Recalculates order total after modification
- ✅ Soft delete (never actually deletes data)

- ✅ Default view hides removed items
- ✅ Toggle view shows all items

### 13. Soft Delete Implementation - Phase 3

## ⚠️ NOT IMPLEMENTED (Phase 4 - Advanced Features)

### Item-Level Status Tracking - Phase 4
**Status**: ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** (Low Priority)

Missing Features:

- ❌ Analytics dashboard showing cancellation patterns

### Additional Missing Endpoints (From Documentation)
**Status**: ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** (Low Priority)
